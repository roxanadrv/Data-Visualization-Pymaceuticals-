# Pymaceuticals Inc. Pharmaceutical Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the data analysis of clinical trial data for Pymaceuticals Inc., a fictional pharmaceutical company. The study focuses on the efficacy of several drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. Specifically, we analyze the performance of Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin treatments.

## Results
Key findings from the study include:
- Capomulin and Ramicane are more effective in reducing tumor sizes.
- There is a strong positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
- Regression analysis shows that our model fits the data with an R-squared value of 0.70, meaning it can fairly accurately predict the tumor volume based on mouse weight.
- The study included an almost equal distribution of female and male mice, ensuring diverse biological factors were considered.
